# [TGRS Undergoing Review] GLGAN

This repo is the official implementation of ['Frequency Decomposition-Driven Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04531).

![framework](https://github.com/sstary/SSRS/blob/main/docs/GLGAN.png)

## Usage
Please download the official pre-trained weights from ['Swin Transformer']([https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04531](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer))--'ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-22K Pretrained Swin-V2 Models'.

Run the GLGAN by: python GLGAN_*.py

Run the decomposition-based GLGAN by: python FDGLGAN_*.py

Please cite our paper if you find it is useful for your research.
